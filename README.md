This is a small research based on EEG dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnair25/Alcoholics/data), where we try to investigate how alcohol affects brain responses to different stimuli, using EEG.

You need to add a path to your local folder on the top of the code, train_folde, since GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB per file.
The raw data can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnair25/Alcoholics/data
Inside you will find Test and Train folders, and loose files. You need to download only Train folder, it's enough for this task.
